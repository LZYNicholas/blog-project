<h2>What is a Malware?</h2>
Malware stands for "Malicious Software" and it is a software usually developed to conduct malicious activities such as stealing sensitive data, modify files and destroy computer systems which violates the <a href="https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/education/what-is-the-cia-triad#:~:text=These%20three%20letters%20stand%20for,objectives%20for%20every%20security%20program." target="_blank">CIA Triad</a>, a fundamental security model.

Below are some of the common malware
<h4>1. Virus</h4>
The most common type of malware is a virus that waits for an unsuspecting user to install it. Once installed, the malware can do the following:
 - Allow hackers to steal sensitive data, modify and delete files from your system
 - Corrupt a system's core functions and cause various problems
 - And many more...

<h4>2. Worms</h4>
A computer worm cause damages similar to a virus. The difference between a worm and a virus is that worms replicate itself to spread to other computers and take advantage of the network's connectivity to infect multiple machines. It can replicate itself without the user's interaction unlike viruses.<br><br>You could say that worm is usually more dangerous than a virus due to its ability to spread quickly.

<h4>3. Trojans</h4>
Trojan Horse is a type of malicious software, disguised as a legitimate software to trick users into installing and using the software. Once the users installed it into the computer system, it can cause damage similar to a worm or a virus. What differentiates trojan horse from worm and virus is that trojan horse is not designed to self-replicate.

<h4>4. Spyware</h4>
Spyware, as the name suggests, spys on your system's data and activities. Spyware helps the hacker by providing the hacker sensitive information obtained from your computer through the malcious software. These sensitive information includes login credentials, banking details and more.

<h4>5. Ransomware</h4>
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts victim's data and demand a ransom from the victim.  After the attacker receives the ransom, the data will be decrypted and returned to the victim. However, paying the ransom does not gaurantee the return of stolen data. Ransomware is commonly used in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cybersecurity/2022/03/04/phishing.html">phishing</a> attacks in order to get their victims.

<h2>What Preventive Measures Can I Take?</h2>
After discussing about what malware is and learning about the destruction that malware can bring to people, it is important that we also discuss the various preventive measures we can take to protect ourselves.
<h4>1. Install Anti-malware applications</h4>
Anti-malware applications helps you to scan, quarantine and remove malware that may reside in your computer. Anti-malware software is very accessible and an effective way to keep malware off your computer provided that you do the scans frequently.  An anti-malware software that I personally use is <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank">Malwarebytes</a> as it is a free, user-friendly and effective anti-malware software. It can also provide real-time protection for premium users. 
<h4>2. Beware of suspicious websites or links.</h4>
It is best practice not to click on suspicious links especially when they are from an unknown source. Clicking on malicious link may result in downloading malwares into your computer system. This is especially common in phishing emails, where they trick users into clicking links or attachments by acting as a trustable entity. You can read my post on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cybersecurity/2022/03/04/phishing.html">phishing</a> to learn more.
<h4>3. Ensure software and operating system is updated</h4>
Many of the malware attacks we see takes advantage of software vulnerabilities in common applications such as operating systems and browser. Software and operating system will have frequent updates to fix bugs and patch these vulnerabilities discovered that could potentially be exploited by hackers. Therefore, always keep in mind to update your software and operating system whenever possible to keep yourself protected from the latest threats.
